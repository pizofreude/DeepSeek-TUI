//! Whale Teams — the Signal Cut whale identities in the terminal.
//!
//! CWC's "Whale Teams / Signal Cut" identity (2026-08-15) gives each agent
//! role a species-led whale and every whale one of six runtime states. This
//! module carries that identity into the TUI as authored glyph art: nothing
//! here is converted from the CWC rasters (there is no vector source), and no
//! CWC file is copied. Colors are Codewhale palette tokens resolved through
//! the live [`UiTheme`], so the whales follow Blue Stage dark/light, the
//! Terminal theme, and ANSI-16 adaptation like every other surface.
//!
//! Contract:
//! - **Role → species is one table** ([`WhaleSpecies::for_role_id`]). Fleet
//!   roles map onto the six species; roles without a species (`worker`,
//!   `general`, `custom`, unknown) render the plain Codewhale whale.
//! - **State is evidence, never decoration.** [`WhaleState`] is derived only
//!   from real runtime facts ([`WhaleState::for_subagent`],
//!   [`WhaleState::for_shell_phase`]). *Working* is asserted only for a child
//!   or turn that is actually running; a portrait rendered without a state
//!   claims nothing about runtime.
//! - **Every state pairs a glyph cue with a word** ([`WhaleState::word`]), so
//!   state never depends on color alone (same rule as `menu_style`).
//! - **Motion is policy-gated.** The Working wake animates only under
//!   [`MotionMode::Full`]; Reduced/Still hold the frame-A poster.
//! - **ASCII-safe by construction.** Every authored glyph has a
//!   [`glyphs::ascii_fallback`] entry, and [`portrait_ascii`] exposes the
//!   narrowed silhouette for tests and text surfaces.
//!
//! Only the *signal-classic* colorway is represented. The three alternate CWC
//! colorways exist only as resting rasters upstream and are not modelled here.
