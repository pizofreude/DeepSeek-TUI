//! Consolidated harness for Gherkin/Cucumber runners.
//!
//! Cucumber (`cucumber = "0.23"`) registers steps per `World` type via
//! inventory. Each `World` is scoped to its own `mod`, so merging the six
//! feature runners into one binary keeps `cargo test -p codewhale-tui
//! tool_lifecycle` etc. filtering via the module path while cutting six link
//! jobs to one. See `crates/tui/tests/README.md`.
